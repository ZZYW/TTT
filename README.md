# About The Project

_ThingThingThing_

_ThingThingThing_ explores open source software development’s potential as a framework for generative narrative made collectively.

_ThingThingThing_ is a zero-player game. The artists and contributors jointly determine its evolution by setting an initial seed state of each _Thing_, which later requires no further human control. Viewers interact with _ThingThingthing_ by navigating a giant eyeball and observing how the world evolves. _ThingThingthing_ is an unending, three-dimensional system of instantiations, each of which is populated by an individual contributor. _ThingThingthing_’s aggregation algorithm copies individual avatars into an upstream account, enabling them to interact with each other.

The artists have been hosting a series of workshops, enabling anyone from students, designers to technologists to quickly build creatures with intelligence and interaction. One can also contribute remotely through _ThingThingthing_’s online development environment. _ThingThingthing_ is not perfect. Anyone can make a _Thing_, with its unique glitches, awkwardness, and clumsiness. Once creators send off their code, they walk away from the keyboard and computer screen, let their Things take on a life of its own in the universe of _ThingThingthing_.

Prior _ThingThingthing_ collaborations also include

- Macy Art Gallery, Teachers College Columbia University;
- Creative Tech Week(CTW) New York;
- Asia Art Archive in America.

# Technical Document

## Properties/Fields For You To Get

```csharp
//Environment
float TOD_Data.main.TimeNow; //e.x. 3:30PM will be represented as 15.5
bool TOD_Data.main.IsDay;
bool TOD_Data.main.IsNight;
bool inWater; //if is in water now
int NeighborCount; //how many neighbors do you have currently
```

## Events You can Use to Fill Code Inside

```csharp
protected override void OnSunset(){}//日落时
protected override void OnSunrise(){}//日出时
protected override void OnMeetingSomeone(GameObject other){}//碰到其他物时
protected override void OnLeavingSomeone(GameObject other){}//离开了其他物时
protected override void OnNeighborSpeaking(){}//有邻居说话时
protected override void OnNeigborSparkingParticles(){}//有邻居发出发光时
protected override void OnTouchWater(){}//进入水时
protected override void OnLeaveWater(){}//离开水时
```

## Settings of your Thing you can change

```csharp
//value is the default setting
settings.cameraOffset = 15; //追踪相机离我的距离
settings.acceleration = 4;//加速度
settings.drag = 1.8f;//速度阻力
settings.mass = 0.2f;//质量
settings.chatBubbleOffsetHeight = 2; //!important! chat bubble offset on Y axis, adjust to avoid chat bubble being blocked by your model 重要！！！！我的对话泡泡的高度！！注意测试调整
settings.getNewDestinationInterval = 5;
settings.newDestinationRange = 40;//随机寻找新目的的时候新目的的范围半径
settings.alwaysFacingTarget = true;
settings.myCubeColor;//我生产出来的小方块的颜色
```

## Ready to Use Methods

```csharp
//movement
SetTarget(Vector3 target); //设定一个目的地
StopMoving(); //不再移动
StopMoving(float forHowManySeconds); //不再移动（并制定一个时间，这个时间后自动开始移动）
RestartWalking(); //重新开始移动
RandomSetDestination();//get a new random target  随机指定一个目的地
ResetPosition(); //change position to spawn point 重置位置

//shape and form
SetScale(Vector3 newScale); //设定尺寸，注意参考你现在的尺寸
ChangeColor(Color newColor); //change color, might not work well if you have more than one renderer or more than one material 更改颜色
ResetColor(); //reset to original color 重制颜色到默认值

//social
Speak(string content, float stayLength); //
Speak(string content);
Mute(); //Speak no longer works //开始沉默，不再讲话
DeMute(); //regain ability to Speak again //不再沉默
Spark(Color particleColor, int numberOfParticles);
PlaySound(int soundEffectId); // Range: 1 ... 102 //播放一个音效，从1-102中选择
PlaySound(string soundFileName); //if you want to play your own sound. but pls make your sound short!!!//播放一个音效，如果你要用自己的声音文件
CreateCube(); //throw a cube on the small ground//制造一个小方块
```

## How to keep your cloned repository up to date

Only do this once

`git remote add upstream https://github.com/ZZYW/thing-thing-thing.git`

Do this to update

`git pull upstream master`

## Where to put my files

#### Where to put my prefabs:

`Resources/Things/[here]`

#### Where to put my materials and scripts

`CREATORS/[your name]/[put here]`

#### Where to put my own sound files

`Resources/Sounds/[here]`

## How to use your own sound files

Find a sound file that is one of the formats below

- .Aif.
- .wav.
- .mp3.
- .ogg.

Compress it if necessary, make sure its file size is smaller than 2 MB, and move it into `Resources/Sounds` folder.

Use `PlaySound(“filename”)` to play your sound, _no extension name needed_.

## Some useful methods from Unity

```csharp
//Print things to Console for debugging
print(object message);

//Invokes the method methodName in time seconds.
Invoke(string methodName, float time);

//Invokes the method methodName in time seconds, then repeatedly every repeatRate seconds.
InvokeRepeating(string methodName, float time, float repeatRate);

//Cancels all Invoke calls on this MonoBehaviour.
CancelInvoke();
```
